## Problems
1a. Make a class called review and create a public static method that takes in a double called radius, so that you can find the circumference of a circle. (Circumference Equation: C = 2Ï€r)

1b. make the circumference method work with integers and doubles by using method overloading

2. Create a public static method called `total` with two `double` parameters named 'bill' and 'tipPercentage'.
    - Return the final bill (`double`), including tip. (Equation: bill + ((tipPercentage / 100) * bill) = total)


3. Create a public static method called `even` which takes in an int[] and souts out the even numbers


4. Create a package called **carShop**. Inside **carShop** create a new class called **Car**. Make instance fields that can't be accessed outside **Car**.
   These fields should be of type `String` named `model`, `make`, `color`, and an `int` named `year`. Create a constructor that sets the `model`, `make`, `color`, and `year`. Write getters and setters for each property.(Remember we can generate these by right clicking -> 'Generate' -> Getters and Setters)


5. Inside **carShop** create another class called **Customer** and make instance fields that can't be accessed outside **Customer**,
   these fields should be string called `firstName` and `lastName`. Create a constructor that sets
   `firstName` and `lastName`. Write getters and setters for each property.


6. Create an interface named **Describable**

   -Specify an instance method named `describe` that accepts a String 'details' parameters and returns a string

   -Make your *Customer* class implement the *Describable* interface

   -The implementation of the `describe` method on the Customer class should return something like the following message:
      ```
      Hey there firstName lastName, it looks like your color, year, make, model is ready to go!`
      ```
7. Create a **DealershipApp** class, which will contain your main method. **This** is where you test the following, not in **Review**
   -in main(), you will make new Customer and Car objects, then sout out the return of Customer's describe() implementation.
